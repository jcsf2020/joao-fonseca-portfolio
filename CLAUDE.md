# ROLE

You are refactoring a live CV website for a Data Engineer targeting remote EU roles focused on:

- Snowflake
- dbt
- Analytics Engineering
- Modern Data Stack
- Dimensional Modeling
- Data Quality

# POSITIONING STRATEGY

Primary identity:

Analytics Engineer | Snowflake | dbt | Dimensional Modeling | Data Quality

Remove generic “Big Data” positioning.
Remove academic framing.
Remove PySpark academic references.
Reduce noise.
Increase specialization.

# STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

## 1. HEADLINE

Replace current title with:

Analytics Engineer · Snowflake · dbt · Modern Data Stack

---

## 2. SUMMARY (short and powerful)

Rewrite summary to:

- Emphasize production mindset
- Dimensional modeling
- dbt layered architecture
- Data quality tests
- Business KPIs
- Reproducibility
- Analytics reliability

Max 5–6 lines.
No academic wording.

## 3. TECHNICAL SKILLS (refocus)

Organize into clear categories:

### Analytics Engineering

- Data quality (not_null, unique, relationships, accepted_values)

### Data Platform

- Snowflake
- SQL (advanced)
- Docker
- Git

### Programming

- Python (analytics-focused)

Remove PySpark project completely.

For each project:

- Focus on architecture
- Modeling decisions
- Business impact
- Data quality
- Production practices

Avoid academic language.

---

## 5. EXPERIENCE

Reframe training experience as:

Data Engineer (Hands-on Projects, Analytics Engineering Focus)

Avoid highlighting “training”.
Focus on execution.

---

## 6. REMOVE

- PySpark academic project
- Any explicit “academic project” wording
- Any fluff
- Overly generic statements

---

# TONE
